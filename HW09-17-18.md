** So, you want to buy a computer and you want to know more about
different operating systems? Please read my blog post and it will help answer many of your questions.

*Windows*:  Evolved from DOS, think Bill Gates when you think of Windows.  It was revolutionary because Windows made the world’s personal computers talk the same language.  It also made Bill Gates a wealthy man.  It could be less expensive than Mac, but it is prone to virus, and worms.  
Price per share (Microsoft): $108 (11/18/2018)

*Linux*:   Came to existence to compete with Windows’ monopoly in the world of personal computers. This operating system needs to be installed in a computer.  It is superior to Windows because it not prone to worms and viruses.

*Mac OS*: When Steve job got fired from his own company, Apple, in 1985, he originated NEXT.  It later gave rise to Mac when Job got rehired at his old company.  Much safer than Windows, less virus, and with the  ability to multitask, it  maybe worth the more expensive price tag.
Price per share (Apple): $193 (11/18/2018)

>Some more points to remember:  As for Graphics,  Mac OS X and Windows allow consistency where as Linux does not.  All three systems allow for multiple users to log in at the same time.**
