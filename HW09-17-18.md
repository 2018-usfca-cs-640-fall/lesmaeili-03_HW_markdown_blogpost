** OS and Linux are similar both based on Unix.  Mac OS came out of Next Step when Steve Job was fired from his own company and went on to start another company and made Next Step..   Windows is different and more complex. Windows is based on DOS. As for Graphics,   OS X and windows allow consistency where are Linux does not.  All three systems allow for multiple users to log in at the same time.**
