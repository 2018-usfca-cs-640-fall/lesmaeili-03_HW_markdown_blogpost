# Git, GitHub, and markdown homework assignment for CS 640
## Due as a pull request on Tuesday, September 18th, 2018 before 11:59 pm

The **goal of this assignment** is to have you practice using Atom to write longer texts in markdown, and to use the git and GitHub workflow we used in class to track your changes as you work and to submit your work back to the class GitHub organization when you are done. You will be writing an essay in the style of a blog post on the similarities and differences between the three major extant computer operating system families: Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

As in all assignments in this class, you are free to reuse code and writing from any of your own past assignments, and to use whatever resources you can find on the web to help you. Keep in mind, though, that using resources from the Internet is different from copying resources from the Internet. **Plagarism is not OK.**

You are free to work with others in the class on this, or ask others for help, but each student must do their own research and writing and must submit their own work individually. You should also practice using Google to search for help if you don't remember how to do something on your own.

**General overview:**

Please follow the instructions carefully and read them all before getting started. Attention to detail is important in programming -- so be sure you follow all the steps, including things like saving your file with the correct file name.

This first homework assignment will be worth 20 points. The grading breakdown will be as follows:

* 10 points - Completes all required steps (as outlined below).
* 10 points - Content of the blog post is accurate and informative, with proper grammar and appropriate style.

You must submit your work as a Pull Request to the class organization ('2018-usfca-cs-640-fall') on GitHub by 11:59 pm on Tuesday, September 18th for full credit. Late assignments will not be accepted, since we will be peer reviewing each other's writing soon after it is submitted.

Steps:

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
1. From the terminal, navigate to the `Desktop` directory on your laptop.
1. Clone your **forked** repository to your laptop by typing `git clone`, then paste the URL from **your** fork on GitHub.
1. Create a new file in this directory, called `operating_system_blog_post.md`, using Atom.
1. Using markdown syntax, write a report in the style of a blog post comparing the three major types of computer operating systems in use today: Windows, MacOS, and Linux. You may want to talk about their history, their stengths and weaknesses, their marketshare, their use in different communities, their interfaces, etc. You should mention near the beginning who your intended audience is -- for example it could be other students, the general public, scientists, etc.
  1. You can use whatever online resources you like to do so, as long as they are properly attributed and linked in the article you write.
  1. You should do your own writing -- do not just copy and paste from other sources.
  1. You can include images if you like, using the markdown image URL syntax, but these should be properly attributed as well unless they are public domain images.
  1. The file should include at least two paragraphs on each of the three operating systems and include a range of different markdown syntax elements (italic, bold, URL links, images, headers, lists, etc).
  1. You can see a rendered version of your writing as you work with the `Packages > Markdown Preview > Toggle Markdown Preview` menu item in Atom.
  1. Save, add, and commit the markdown file *as you work on it*. You can't have too many commits, but you can have too few. Don't wait until you're done to add and commit your changes. Get in the habit of committing whenever you are done with a nice chunk of work.
2. Push your new commits to your fork on GitHub and then open a Pull Request back to the organization repository to submit the asignment. You can still continue adding changes after you open the Pull Request. Regardless of when the Pull Request is opened, I will count any commits made before the deadline as on time.

Don't hesistate to ask questions on Piazza as you work!
